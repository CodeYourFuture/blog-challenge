										<p>Most people who bake professional would sink into the ground if you asked them to make you these delectable treats. The one thing they all say is "what am I doing wrong!*$?" Such is the fear that macarons are very much sought after and a hefty price is paid for those cravings.
										</p>
										<p class="read-more-target">
										A good Macaron is actually easy to achieve, a perfect crispy shiny shell with “feet” around the base. Once you get your lips around them you begin to quiver as the meringue dissolves in your mouth a smooth taste and aroma. 
										</p>
										<p class="read-more-target">The one thing that you have to remember when making your (101st) attempt, is...patience. As you will soon find out from a master class with Adriano Zumbo one of Australia's number one Pastry chefs
										</p>
										<p class="read-more-target">I was just about to give up when I stumbled across this wonderful website by Ms Emma at  
											<a href="http://thecakemistress.com/blog/articles/macaron-adriano-zumbo/" target="_blank">www.thecakemistress.com
											</a>
										where she takes you step by step through the process. I must admit I was sceptical, but, alas I was pleasantly surprised!! I have made it happen with my first try. 
										</p>
										<p class="read-more-target"> What can I say Ms Emma, I love you for sharing. xoxox

										<p>Just as the weather is taking a break from that sunkissed summer. Winter is approaching with a vengance and I am feeling a little cold, needing and wanting a pick me up. Viola! It time to make some frangipanes. 
										</p>
										<p class="read-more-target">
										Most people think that making these delightful pastries is a chore, but I can assure you that it can come together in less than an hour. I have tried several different recipes and the one that has worked perfectly for me is by Dominic at Belleau's Kitchen and leaves me salivating for more and satisfied at the same time.
										</p>
										<p class="read-more-target">What I love about this recipe is that you can use pretty much any fruit in season(except citrus fruits!) and it tastes delicious everytime. I did experimented with the pastry, and tried to be a bit fancy by using metal pastry cutter tubes. As you can see they look just like a pro and are perfect not just for you but also as a party delight.
										</p>
										<p class="read-more-target">For that final touch, add a double dipping cream and you will be in heaven. I can assure you that there will be none left at the end of the day.</p>
										<p class="read-more-target">The Recipe can be found at 
											<a href="http://www.belleaukitchen.com/2014/06/raspberry-and-blueberry-mini-frangipane.html" target="_blank">www.belleaukitchen.com
											</a>.
										Do let me know how the recipe worked for you and any inventive ideas that I can try.

										<p>Hearty and heavenly. Thats exactly what comes to mind. Nothing compares to humble beef burger. This is the only savory food that can hold my attention. I asked myself why not make it out of cake, can you see where I am going... surely someone out there must have. After trawling through hundreds of websites, my heart was set on trying them.
										</p>
										<p class="read-more-target">And "Yes" I wanted fries with that. I came across this nondescript website called
											<a href="http://www.frankie.com.au/blogs/food/frankie-fodder-burger-cupcakes" target="_blank">www.frankie.com.au
											</a> 
										which had beautifully illustrated images and easy to understand instructions. The game was on.
										</p>
										<p class="read-more-target">Unlike any of my other foodie journies, I really wanted this to work as I had been tasked with making cup cakes for my friends daughter's 9th birthday. And as we all know kids these days have sophisticated palettes and pretty much snob at anything that isn't on trend.
										</p>
										<p class="read-more-target">So I got started nice and early in the morning. I baked the cup cakes and the sheet cakes. I was feeling good at this point. But when it comes to fondant. I must confess, I am useless. So I opted for the packet(very naughty of me!). I was very proud of my efforts.The only thing left was the 'fries', oh well you dont expect me to make those. I got some salted chip sticks and sprinkled them with icing sugar. Hey! What do they know. They tasted pretty good to me.
										</p>
										<p class="read-more-target">Needless to say they were a hit. And 'Yes' the birthday girl thinks I am a rock star baker. If only she knew!
