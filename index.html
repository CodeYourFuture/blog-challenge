        <h2>You can socialise a Kitten</h2>
      </header>
      <content>
        <p>Most people do not think about socializing cats or kittens. The whole behavior thinking process of a cat is different from a dog since they are mostly solitary. As household pets living with a family and exposed to all kinds of situations it is beneficial to give your cat the best and most interesting life you can. It will help if you expose your cat to many different things.</p>

        <p>Instead of socializing, you could call the work you do with a cat “desensitization.” This means they are calm or cooperative in many new or different situations. As a cat parent you are probably saying it can’t be done.  Yes cat training is possible and can start at a young age. In fact, most people have never bothered to work with their cats and believe all the old myths floating around about our finicky feline friends.</p>

        <h2>If you’re brave, adopt a Kitten!</h2>
      </header>
      <content>
        <p>Your first important decision is to determine the proper time to adopt the pet. If the kitten is under 8 weeks of age, it should stay with its mother and litter mates until they are at least 10 weeks old. Kittens learn valuable social skills from the mother cat and the siblings at this time, such as how to inhibit biting, proper play and the all important litter box habits.</p>

        <p>If you are really clever, adopt two kittens at the same time. They will naturally bond with each other and play together—giving you and your household a break. When it comes to kittens, 2 really is better than 1. Please see our article <a href="http://catsinternational.org/when-two-is-better-than-one/" target="_blank">When two is better than one.</a></p>
